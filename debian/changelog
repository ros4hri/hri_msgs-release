ros-humble-hri-msgs (0.7.2-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * Merge branch 'gaze-style' into 'master'
    create LookAtWithStyle.msg
    See merge request ros4hri/hri_msgs!3
  * create LookAtWithStyle.msg
    users can specify how the GazeManager creates trajectories using the
    style member.
    currently NORMAL (using both neck and eyes) as well as EYES_ONLY and
    NECK_ONLY exist and are supported by the GazeManager v2.

ros-humble-hri-msgs (0.6.0-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * revise IdsMatch to enable associations between any 2 ids, incl ids of same type
    This is especially useful to be able to 'merge' 2 people (eg, alias one to the other)
    by publishing a 'match' between 2 person ids

ros-humble-hri-msgs (0.3.0-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * remove GroupsStamped and GazesStamped
    GroupsStamped and GazesStamped are essentially arrays of Groups and Gazes, they are not needed as
    nodes would simply publish several message on the corresponding topics
  * {GazeSenderReceiver->Gaze}.msg and rename fields in Group.msg and GazeSenderReceiver.msg
  * add LiveSpeech.msg for encoding of incremental results of speech-to-text

ros-humble-hri-msgs (0.2.0-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * AgeAndGender.msg -> SoftBiometrics.msg
  * remove RoIStamped, as not necessary
    The original rationale was to be able to match the RoI to the orginal sourc eimage via the timestamp,
    but it was clunky, and we have decided instead to republish the face image under cropped, alleviating
    the need for the connection to the source image.
  * IdsMatch: revise semantic to enable eg face<->body matches

ros-humble-hri-msgs (0.1.0-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * package.xml format 3 + clean up of unused dependencies
  * Removed services which do not make sense in the current ros4hri standard
  * IdsList.msg: add a header
    This is critical to be able to reliably match the list of tracked faces/bodies/voices to actually face/body/voice subtopics.
  * IdsList and RegionOfInterestStamped were not actualyl built
  * Added a stamped version of RegionOfInterest
    This is important to associate the timestamp of the original image to eg a detected face RoI
  * add msg for list of face/body/voice/person ids
  * FacialLandmarks coordinates are in normalised pixels
    This now matches what PointOfInterest2D stores.
