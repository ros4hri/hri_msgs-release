0.7.1 (2022-07-20)
------------------

0.7.0 (2022-06-28)
------------------
* expressions: expand list + use string constants
  The list is based on Chambers' MSc thesis, Bristol Robotics lab 2020
* Contributors: Séverin Lemaignan

0.6.0 (2022-06-01)
------------------
* revise IdsMatch to enable associations between any 2 ids, incl ids of same type
  This is especially useful to be able to 'merge' 2 people (eg, alias one to the other)
  by publishing a 'match' between 2 person ids
* Contributors: Séverin Lemaignan

0.5.2 (2022-05-04)
------------------
* omitted to update CMakeLists
* Contributors: Séverin Lemaignan

0.5.1 (2022-05-04)

* Contributors: antonioandriella

------------------
* add social engagement msg with 5 discrete levels
* add confidence to Expression message
* update README
* Contributors: Séverin Lemaignan

0.4.1 (2022-01-25)
------------------
* CMakeLists: update references to BodyPosture and Gesture messages
* add BSD LICENSE file
* Contributors: Séverin Lemaignan

0.4.0 (2022-01-25)
------------------
* split BodyAttitude into BodyPosture and Gesture
* Contributors: Séverin Lemaignan

0.3.0 (2022-01-21)
------------------

* remove GroupsStamped and GazesStamped
  GroupsStamped and GazesStamped are essentially arrays of Groups and Gazes, they are not needed as
  nodes would simply publish several message on the corresponding topics
* {GazeSenderReceiver->Gaze}.msg and rename fields in Group.msg and GazeSenderReceiver.msg
* add LiveSpeech.msg for encoding of incremental results of speech-to-text
* Contributors: Séverin Lemaignan

0.2.1 (2022-01-12)
------------------
* update CMakeLists following removing/renaming of messages
* Contributors: Séverin Lemaignan

0.2.0 (2022-01-12)
------------------
* AgeAndGender.msg -> SoftBiometrics.msg
* remove RoIStamped, as not necessary
  The original rationale was to be able to match the RoI to the orginal sourc eimage via the timestamp,
  but it was clunky, and we have decided instead to republish the face image under cropped, alleviating
  the need for the connection to the source image.
* IdsMatch: revise semantic to enable eg face<->body matches
* Contributors: Séverin Lemaignan

0.1.2 (2021-12-01)
------------------
* Added IdsMatch.msg to publish potential matches between face/body/voice ids
  and person ids

0.1.1 (2021-11-09)
------------------
* Added CHANGELOG

0.1.0 (2021-11-09)
------------------
* package.xml format 3 + clean up of unused dependencies
* Removed services which do not make sense in the current ros4hri standard
* IdsList.msg: add a header
  This is critical to be able to reliably match the list of tracked faces/bodies/voices to actually face/body/voice subtopics.
* IdsList and RegionOfInterestStamped were not actualyl built
* Added a stamped version of RegionOfInterest
  This is important to associate the timestamp of the original image to eg a detected face RoI
* add msg for list of face/body/voice/person ids
* FacialLandmarks coordinates are in normalised pixels
  This now matches what PointOfInterest2D stores.
* Github links in README
* Added AudioFeatures.msg, based on INTERSPEECH features
* Update AgeAndGender.msg (capitalisation)
* Delete BodyPose.msg
* Typo fixes
* Update README.md
